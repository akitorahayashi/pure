## Runtime Configuration

The CLI currently uses command-line flags as the primary runtime configuration surface.

- Category selection: `--type`, `--all`
- Scope selection: `--current` or explicit path arguments
- Deletion confirmation control: `-y/--yes`
- Verbose reporting: `-v/--verbose`

Debug logging for run flow can be enabled with environment variable `PRF_DEBUG`.

## CI/CD Contract

- `.github/workflows/ci-workflows.yml` orchestrates reusable workflows for static checks, tests, coverage, and build.
- Static checks, tests, and coverage execute via `mise exec -- just <recipe>`.
- `release.yml` delegates tagged release builds to `build.yml` using a `release_id` handoff.

## Release

`v*` tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which prepares a release, calls `.github/workflows/build.yml` for matrix builds, uploads artifacts, and publishes the release.
